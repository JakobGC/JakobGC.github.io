subtitle: So you want to learn more about me or are you here to learn why my website is about lizards and wizards?

My name is Jakob Cedergren and I am a senior History major at Williams College. I have always wanted to take a computer science class during my time at Williams and I felt that electronic textiles would teach me basic computer science skills and possibly some engineering principles too. Since programming has become such an important field in the modern world, I felt obligated to learn and at least be somewhat familiar with the practice. During the semester I would like to learn and refine some programming skills, as well as to build a unique final project which showcases what I have learned in electronic textiles.

P.S. The lizards and wizards thing is just super random and it is entertaining for me
