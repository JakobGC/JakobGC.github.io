TRAFFIC LIGHT PROJECT

Description: 

This project will be an operational traffic light that will switch between green, yellow, and red at appropriate, realistic times.
It will be operated by the arduino lilypad board where the RGB on the back side will mimic the LED's at the front of the traffic light.
The traffic light can be turned on and off via a switch and the brightness will be determined via a light sensor.
