The assignment was to create a light circuit for one LED that was operated through a homemade switch. Using conductive thread patches and another conductive element (such as a paperclip), we can craft a homemade switch. The goal is to create an aesthetically pleasing stitch with the incorporation of an LED light.

Tip: My tip would be to use the needle to break through the conductive thread patches prior to trying to stitch it. I found that it made all of the sewing much easier because you don't have to use a lot of energy trying to break through the fabric and conductive thread patches.
