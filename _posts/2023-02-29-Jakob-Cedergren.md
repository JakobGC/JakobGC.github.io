The assignment was to create a code version of the plushy light circuit. It mirrors what happens to the LED lights if you turn the button on/off and the switch on/off.
The code will create an output determining which LED's are on and which are off.





Output

![ON, ON, ON](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/124645204/222235010-23495443-36f6-44b4-9a45-8261a3237c38.jpg)



Tip: My tip would be to use several indents and lines to better organize the code so it is easier to work within it.
