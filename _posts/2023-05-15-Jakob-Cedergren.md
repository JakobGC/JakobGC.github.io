THE POCKET TRAFFIC LIGHT PROJECT

Comprehensive Materials List:

- 1x Arduino board
- 1x Arduino Light Sensor
- 1x Arduino Light Switch
- 3x LED's (Red, Yellow, Green)
- 1x Conductive Thread Spool
- 1x Black Thread Spool
- 1x Grey Thread Spool
- 1x Paper Towel Roll
- 7x Alligator Clips
- 1x Lithium Battery

Description: 

This project will be an operational traffic light that will switch between green, yellow, and red at appropriate, realistic times.
It will be operated by the arduino lilypad board where the RGB on the back side will mimic the LED's at the front of the traffic light.
The traffic light can be turned on and off via a switch and the brightness will be determined via a light sensor.

3 tips to my past self:

- Think before you code, map out your code on paper before starting to code
- Use an embroidery hoop when sewing to make sewing easier and more efficient
- Look at Professor Howley's lectures and files when stuck instead of trying to figure it out on your own for hours
