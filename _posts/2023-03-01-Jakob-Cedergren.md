The assignment was to create a code that would determine what kind of meal plan you would have, then what kind of meal you would get. It's based off of even and odd numbers
that determine which menu you get. Then there are 3 different meals you can be assigned between the two different meal plans.

Tip: My tip would be to use modular arithmetic to differentiate between odd and even numbers. It made the code much simpler to build.
