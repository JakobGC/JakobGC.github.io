This code turns on a random PWM pin to a random value every second. It then picks a new pin, or turns it off. 
If a pin is already off then it will randomize a new value to it. This code utilizes arrays.

Tip: I would look at some clips on youtube if you get confused on arrays, that really helped me figure it out.
