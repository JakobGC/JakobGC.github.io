This program is a ghost detector, ghosts are only around at certain light values and temperature values. This code programs a light and temperature sensor so that when 
the lights are low enough and temperatures are low enough, LED's turn red which signals that a ghost is around. SPOOKY!

Tip: My tip would be to write out all of your variables on a seperate sheet of paper and try to map out what you are trying to do with your code using your variables.
