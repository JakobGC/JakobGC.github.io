I had to write a code that would inform you of what clothes to wear depending on the temperature outside. If its cold, the code might tell you to wear a sweater. If it is hot, the code might tell you to wear shorts.

One tip for this assigment is to be creative about what the code relays, writing something funny can make the code unique.


Check out my code
