The assignment was to create a program that would loop LED's and have them alternate between RED BLUE and GREEN every 3 times while using a "while loop".





Output

![Red blue green](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/124645204/223894357-b2bd24c2-82a4-4b1b-8992-9ccf9e361355.jpg)



Tip: My tip would be to use modular arithmetic to help alternate in groups of 3.
